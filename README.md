# Customer Purchasing Behavior Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project involves analyzing customer purchasing behavior to uncover actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies, promotions, and store operations. The dataset includes transactional, promotional, and store-specific data, which were analyzed to answer key business questions and guide future decision-making.

---

## Business Objectives  
1. Evaluate the impact of promotions on customer purchasing patterns.  
2. Identify seasonal trends and holiday-related purchasing behaviors.  
3. Examine the correlation between customer volume and sales.  
4. Assess the influence of store characteristics (e.g., assortment type, competitor distance) on sales performance.  
5. Provide actionable insights for sales strategy and marketing optimization.
