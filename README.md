# Rossmann Sales Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales for Rossmann stores based on historical sales data and various influencing factors. Two primary approaches were employed: Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). The project aims to enhance decision-making by forecasting sales trends, optimizing promotional strategies, and understanding store-specific dynamics.



## Business Objectives
1. **Sales Forecasting**: Predict future sales with high accuracy to support inventory and staffing decisions.
2. **Promotion Impact Analysis**: Evaluate how promotions influence sales trends across different stores.
3. **Seasonal and Holiday Trends**: Identify patterns in sales related to seasons and state holidays.
4. **Store Performance Evaluation**: Assess how store-specific features (e.g., assortment type, competition distance) affect overall sales.
5. **Actionable Insights**: Provide recommendations for improving marketing strategies and operational efficiency.



## Datasets
- **Train Dataset**: Historical sales data (`train.csv`).
- **Test Dataset**: Data for sales prediction (`test.csv`).
- **Store Dataset**: Store-related attributes (`store.csv`).
- **Sample Submission**: Template for submitting predictions (`sample_submission.csv`).

### 4. Promotional Impact
| Promo | Average Sales |
|-------|---------------|
| 0     | 4406.05       |
| 1     | 7991.15       |



## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning.

  - `logging` for maintaining a record of execution.
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks



## Methodologies
### Machine Learning
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted key features such as month, year, day, and holiday indicators.
- **Modeling**: Employed Random Forest and XGBoost models for predictive analysis.
- **Evaluation**: Used metrics like RMSE and RÂ² to evaluate model performance.

### Deep Learning
- **Neural Network Design**: Built a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized layers, activation functions, and learning rates.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed performance using validation accuracy and loss metrics.



## Recommendations
1. **Promotional Strategies**:
   - Focus promotions during high-traffic periods (e.g., holidays, weekends) to maximize sales.
   - Use personalized promotions based on customer segmentation.

2. **Sales Forecasting**:
   - Integrate predictive models into operational planning to better manage inventory and workforce.

3. **Store Optimization**:
   - Analyze competition distance and store characteristics to enhance store layouts and marketing efforts.

4. **Automated Pipelines**:
   - Automate data processing and model retraining to keep predictions up-to-date.
